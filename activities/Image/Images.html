        <p> 1. JPEG is best for photographers and images with many colors, gradients, and details.</p>
        <p>2. GIF works best for simple images with few colors, like logos, icons or small graphics. It also supports animaton, which is why it's often used for short moving images.</p>
        <p>3.PNG supports lossless compression, meaninng no image quality is lost.It allows transparency too.</p>
        <p>4. We open the photo and edit size or scale opton, set the width and height to the exact size you need. </p>
        <p>5. If we use CSS, the file size of the original large image is still loaded, which slows down your oage. Uding Photo editing software reduces the catual file size before uploading, making the website load faster and more efficient.</p>
