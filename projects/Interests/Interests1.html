            <h1> My Interest on Arts</h1>
            <p> Arts has always been a meaningful part of my life because it gives me a way to express myself beyond words. I find beauty in colors, shapes, and movements that tell stories, and I enjoy how art allows me to connect with emotions and ideas on a deeper level. Whether it is through paiting, drawing, or photogrraphy, I feel that art captures feelings that can't always be explained in sentences. When I create or observe art, I notice the small details that reveals creativity and effort, which inspires me to see the world in different perspectives.</p>
            <p> For me, art is not just about making something beautiful, it is about communicating expriences, memories, and imagination in ways that otheres can feel and relate to. My interest in art also comes hpw it can bring people together. Art is universal; even if people do not speak the same language, they can still understand a painting, a song or a dance. I enjoy how art can reflect culture, history and personal identity, reminding us of both our differences and our shared humanity. It has power to heal, motivate and inspire chnage.</p>
